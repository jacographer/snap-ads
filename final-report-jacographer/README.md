## The Final-est Deadline

Given the time it will take me to grade all final assignments across my classes, and the deadline on *me* to submit final grades from the university, **I *can't* accept any assignments after May 4.**
:::

Your final project should be a data report of any variety, but ideally will be a mashup of a few different data analysis approaches we've taken in the course. If you are looking for data to work with, or just some inspiration, I would recommend scanning through the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) github repository.

### Suggested timeline

-   Meet with me in office hours on Monday **April 17** or **April 24** to discuss your project plans.

-   Push a draft report to Github by **April 26** for feedback.

-   Push the final report by **May 4. ðŸš¨THIS IS A HARD DEADLINE ðŸš¨**

## How to use github

I won't grade anything until you've told me that the project is submitted through the canvas submission. Therefore, commit and push to Github regularly. The best way to ask for help will be to reference files and lines that are on github.

## What to submit:

Draft your report and code in `final-project.qmd`. Once you've made your final commit and pushed it to github, submit a "Project submitted" message on canvas.
